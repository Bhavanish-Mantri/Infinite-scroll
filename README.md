## Infinite Scroll

A modern and minimal blog-style web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project demonstrates **infinite scrolling**, **live search filtering**, and a clean **aesthetic UI** without using any external frameworks.

This project focuses on frontend fundamentals, UI polish, and user experience.

##  Features

- Infinite scrolling to load posts dynamically  
- Live search to filter posts by title or content  
- Clean and aesthetic dark-themed UI  
- Smooth loading indicator for better user feedback  
- Fully responsive design  
- No frameworks or libraries used  

---

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – structure of the application  
- **CSS3** – styling, layout, animations, and theme  
- **JavaScript** – dynamic content loading, filtering, and events

##  How It Works

- Posts are displayed dynamically using JavaScript  
- As the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, more posts are loaded  
- The search input filters visible posts in real time  
- A loader animation provides visual feedback while new posts load  

---

##  Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser  
2. Scroll down to load more posts automatically  
3. Type in the search box to filter posts instantly

##  Learning Outcomes

- Improved understanding of DOM manipulation  
- Implemented infinite scroll logic  
- Practiced clean UI design without frameworks  
- Learned how to manage loading states and animations

## Notes

- This project currently uses **static demo content** for displaying posts  
- **No external API is used** in the current implementation  
- In the future, the project can be extended to fetch posts from a real API  
- No backend or database is included at this stage
