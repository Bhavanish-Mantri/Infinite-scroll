- As the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, more posts are loaded  
- The search input filters visible posts in real time  
- A loader animation provides visual feedback while new posts load  

---

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser  
2. Scroll down to load more posts automatically  
3. Type in the search box to filter posts instantly
